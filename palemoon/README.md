# Palemoon

Note that most of the stuff in this Repo also applies to Palemoon. However,
since palemoon doesn't support web extensions, I thought it would be nice to
have some specific information about it.

## Disable Ctrl+Q Shortcut

Many of the extensions that exist to disable the Ctrl+q shortcut use web
extensions. I found this extension though that is legacy and works with palemoon
though. See the XPI file.

The extension was made by [choobin]/[dcqs]. Many thanks to them for this. Per
the licensing for the extension, the XPI file contains the License, and I have
also provided the license file here in this folder.
